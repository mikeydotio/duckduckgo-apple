# Interactive Swipe-Up to Open the Tab Overview (iOS)

## Context

`swipe-up-spec.md` describes a finger-tracking, fully reversible gesture that transitions the
current page into the all-tabs overview (the "tab switcher"). It is **not** a fire-and-forget
trigger — progress is bound to the finger and only finalized on release (commit vs. cancel by
position + velocity). Scope: **iPhone only**, **bottom address bar only**, additive (the tabs
button and every other entry point stay unchanged). Per the spec author's decision, v1 supports
**both web pages and the New Tab Page** as the starting surface. The whole feature ships behind a
new **internal/experimental feature flag** — no separate user setting; flag on = feature on.

Today the tab switcher is opened **non-interactively**: the tabs button runs
`requestTabSwitcher()` → `segueToTabSwitcher()` which `present(_, animated: true)`s
`TabSwitcherViewController` with a custom `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`
(`TabSwitcherTransitionDelegate`) that vends a snapshot "zoom into the cell" animator
(`FromWebViewTransition` for web pages, `FromHomeScreenTransition` for the NTP). There is **no
interactive transition anywhere** in this flow yet. This project adds one.

## Approach (key decisions)

1. **Make the *existing* transition interactive — don't rewrite it.** Drive the existing
   `FromWebViewTransition` / `FromHomeScreenTransition` with a `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition`.
   Their `UIView.animateKeyframes(.calculationModeLinear)` animations scrub cleanly under percent-driven
   interaction (UIKit pauses the container layer and scrubs `timeOffset`). The only thing blocking
   reuse is that each animator hard-codes `transitionContext.completeTransition(true)` — wrong on the
   cancel path. Changing it to `completeTransition(!transitionContext.transitionWasCancelled)` is
   behavior-preserving for the button tap (never cancelled → still `true`) and correct for the gesture.
   **Result: the gesture lands pixel-identical to the button tap, with near-zero new animation code.**
   (Fallback if on-device scrubbing shows artifacts: introduce dedicated linear-`UIView.animate`
   animator subclasses. Not expected to be needed.)

2. **Present synchronously on gesture start.** `segueToTabSwitcher` is `async` only because it
   `await`s `TabSwitcherTrackerCountViewModel.calculateInitialState(...)` before presenting. For 1:1
   tracking, `present(_, animated: true)` must run the instant the gesture passes threshold. Only the
   tracker *count* is async; present with the synchronous default state and let the VM refresh after
   appearance. Achieved by extracting a synchronous controller-builder and a new synchronous interactive
   entry point, leaving the button-tap async path untouched.

3. **Vend the interactor only during the gesture.** `TabSwitcherTransitionDelegate` gets a `weak`
   `activeInteractor` and implements `interactionControllerForPresentation(using:)`. Button taps never
   set it → returns `nil` → normal animated present (current behavior fully preserved).

4. **Mirror the existing gesture infrastructure.** A new pan-gesture file copies the shape of
   `MainViewController+UnifiedToggleInputSwipeTabs.swift` (recognizer subclass + install + factory +
   `@objc handle` + `shouldBegin`). Attached to the bottom-bar region (`toolbar` +
   `navigationBarContainer`). Coexists with the existing horizontal tab-swipe pan by axis exclusion.

**De-risked during research:** `tabSwitcherController` is declared `weak`
(`MainViewController.swift:242`), so a cancelled presentation releases the controller and the ref
auto-nils — the "tabs button soft-bricks after cancel" risk the design flagged is largely handled by
the language. We still null the interactor explicitly and verify on-device.

## 1. Feature flag

- **`iOS/Core/FeatureFlag.swift`** — add an enum case (near the other internal flags, e.g.
  `webScrollFreezeObservability`):
  ```swift
  /// Internal-only: interactive swipe-up from the bottom bar to open the tab overview
  /// (iPhone, bottom address bar only). https://app.asana.com/<this-project-task>
  case swipeUpToTabSwitcher
  ```
  and its `Config` in the `config` switch (mirror the `webScrollFreezeObservability` line exactly):
  ```swift
  case .swipeUpToTabSwitcher:
      Config(defaultValue: .internalOnly, source: .remoteReleasable(iOSBrowserConfigSubfeature.swipeUpToTabSwitcher))
  ```
  `.internalOnly` + default `supportsLocalOverriding: true` ⇒ on for internal users, off in
  production, and auto-listed in the debug **Feature Flags** menu for toggling on a sim/device.
- **`SharedPackages/BrowserServicesKit/Sources/PrivacyConfig/Features/PrivacyFeature.swift`** — add
  `case swipeUpToTabSwitcher` to `iOSBrowserConfigSubfeature`.

Runtime check idiom (already used in `MainViewController`): `featureFlagger.isFeatureOn(.swipeUpToTabSwitcher)`.

## 2. Make the transition interactive

**`iOS/DuckDuckGo/Transitions/TabSwitcherTransition.swift`** — extend `TabSwitcherTransitionDelegate`:
```swift
weak var activeInteractor: UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition?   // set only during the gesture

func interactionControllerForPresentation(using animator: UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning)
        -> UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning? {
    return activeInteractor          // nil for button taps → non-interactive present (unchanged)
}
```
`animationController(forPresented:)` stays as-is — it already returns `FromHomeScreenTransition` when
`mainVC.newTabPageViewController != nil`, else `FromWebViewTransition`, so **both surfaces work**.
Do **not** implement `interactionControllerForDismissal` (the inverse interactive transition is out of scope).

**`iOS/DuckDuckGo/Transitions/WebViewTransition.swift`** and
**`iOS/DuckDuckGo/Transitions/HomeScreenTransition.swift`** — in the presentation animators
(`FromWebViewTransition`, `FromHomeScreenTransition`) replace the completion-block
`transitionContext.completeTransition(true)` with
`transitionContext.completeTransition(!transitionContext.transitionWasCancelled)`. (Apply the same to
the `To*` animators for correctness even though dismissal stays non-interactive.) Overlay teardown
(`solidBackground`/`imageContainer` removal) already runs unconditionally in completion — good for the
cancel path.

## 3. Synchronous present refactor

**`iOS/DuckDuckGo/MainViewController+Segues.swift`** (current `segueToTabSwitcher` at `:197-260`):
- Extract the controller-construction body (from `DuckAIGridContentResolver` through
  `tabSwitcherController = controller`) into a **synchronous** helper:
  ```swift
  private func makeTabSwitcherController(initialTrackerCountState: TabSwitcherTrackerCountViewModel.State,
                                         forceFireTabsTip: Bool) -> TabSwitcherViewController?
  ```
- The existing `async segueToTabSwitcher` keeps its `await calculateInitialState(...)`, then calls
  `makeTabSwitcherController(...)`, then `present(animated: true)` — **no behavior change**.
- Add the interactive entry point:
  ```swift
  func beginInteractiveTabSwitcherPresentation(interactor: UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition) -> Bool {
      guard tabSwitcherController == nil else { return false }
      hideAllHighlightsIfNeeded()
      guard let controller = makeTabSwitcherController(initialTrackerCountState: .hidden,
                                                       forceFireTabsTip: false) else { return false }
      tabSwitcherTransition.activeInteractor = interactor   // BEFORE present, so UIKit vends it
      present(controller, animated: true)
      return true
  }
  ```
  Use `TabSwitcherTrackerCountViewModel.State.hidden` as the synchronous initial state; the VM
  refreshes the real count on appearance (verify the VC already calls `refresh()`/`refreshAsync()` on
  appear — `TabSwitcherTrackerCountViewModel.swift` — and only add an explicit refresh if it does not).

**Preview snapshot:** the button path runs the *async* `updatePreviewForCurrentTab { … }` before
presenting; the interactive path cannot await it. The `From*` animators read either a **cached**
web-view preview (`previewsSource.preview(for:)`) or a **synchronous** live snapshot (NTP uses
`resizableSnapshotView(afterScreenUpdates: false)`). In the gesture's `.began`, before presenting,
capture the current surface synchronously (reuse the existing synchronous snapshot path; for a web view
fall back to the cached preview if a sync capture isn't readily available) so the first interactive
frame is fresh. Exact capture call to be finalized against `updatePreviewForCurrentTab`'s internals —
hard constraint: **must be synchronous**.

## 4. The gesture — new file `iOS/DuckDuckGo/Transitions/MainViewController+SwipeUpToTabSwitcher.swift`

Mirrors `MainViewController+UnifiedToggleInputSwipeTabs.swift`:
```swift
final class SwipeUpToTabSwitcherPanGestureRecognizer: UIPanGestureRecognizer {}

extension MainViewController {
    func installSwipeUpToTabSwitcherGesture() {
        guard featureFlagger.isFeatureOn(.swipeUpToTabSwitcher) else { return }
        viewCoordinator.toolbar.addGestureRecognizer(makeSwipeUpToTabSwitcherPanGesture())
        viewCoordinator.navigationBarContainer.addGestureRecognizer(makeSwipeUpToTabSwitcherPanGesture())
    }

    private func makeSwipeUpToTabSwitcherPanGesture() -> SwipeUpToTabSwitcherPanGestureRecognizer {
        let pan = SwipeUpToTabSwitcherPanGestureRecognizer(target: self,
                                                           action: #selector(handleSwipeUpToTabSwitcherPan(_:)))
        pan.delegate = self
        pan.maximumNumberOfTouches = 1
        return pan
    }

    func shouldBeginSwipeUpToTabSwitcherPan(_ pan: UIPanGestureRecognizer) -> Bool {
        guard featureFlagger.isFeatureOn(.swipeUpToTabSwitcher),
              UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom == .phone,            // iPhone only
              appSettings.currentAddressBarPosition.isBottom,           // bottom bar only
              tabSwitcherController == nil,                             // not already presenting
              presentedViewController == nil,                          // no modal up
              !omniBar.isTextFieldEditing                              // not editing the address bar
        else { return false }
        let v = pan.velocity(in: pan.view)
        return v.y < 0 && abs(v.y) > abs(v.x)                          // upward-vertical dominant
    }
}
```
Note: **no** `newTabPageViewController == nil` guard — both web and NTP surfaces are supported (the
delegate already picks the right animator).

**State machine** (`@objc func handleSwipeUpToTabSwitcherPan(_:)`), reference distance ≈
`viewCoordinator.contentContainer.bounds.height`, `progress = clamp(-translation.y / reference, 0, 1)`:
- `.began`: capture preview synchronously (§3); create `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition`
  (`completionCurve = .easeOut`), store it strongly on `self.tabSwitcherInteractor`; fire the same
  open pixels as the button path **only on commit** (see `.ended`) — at `.began` optionally run
  `performCancel()` to match button behavior; call `beginInteractiveTabSwitcherPresentation(interactor:)`;
  if it returns `false`, drop the interactor and disable/re-enable the recognizer to bail.
- `.changed`: `tabSwitcherInteractor?.update(progress)`. (Reversal is handled natively — `update`
  just re-scrubs; repeated up/down within one gesture works with no special code.)
- `.ended`: commit if `velocity.y < -flickThreshold` (≈ 700–900 pt/s) **or** `progress >= commitProgress`
  (≈ 0.30–0.40). Commit → set `completionSpeed` (~1.0, ~1.2 on flick) and `finish()` + fire the
  open/daily pixels (extract a `fireTabSwitcherOpenedPixels()` helper from `requestTabSwitcher()` so
  button and gesture share it). Otherwise → `cancel()`. Then `tabSwitcherInteractor = nil`.
- `.cancelled`/`.failed`: `tabSwitcherInteractor?.cancel()`; `tabSwitcherInteractor = nil`.

Consider extracting the pure decisions — `progress(forTranslation:reference:)` and
`shouldCommit(progress:velocity:)` — as static funcs so they're unit-testable.

## 5. Wiring (`iOS/DuckDuckGo/MainViewController.swift`)

- Add stored property near `lazy var tabSwitcherTransition` (`:252`):
  `var tabSwitcherInteractor: UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition?` (strong owner during gesture).
- `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin` (`:6003`) — add a branch **before** the unified-input one:
  ```swift
  if let pan = gestureRecognizer as? SwipeUpToTabSwitcherPanGestureRecognizer {
      return shouldBeginSwipeUpToTabSwitcherPan(pan)
  }
  ```
- `shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWith` (`:5999`, currently returns `true` globally) — add axis exclusion
  so the new vertical pan and the existing horizontal `UnifiedInputSwipeTabsPanGestureRecognizer` never
  run together:
  ```swift
  if (gestureRecognizer is SwipeUpToTabSwitcherPanGestureRecognizer && otherGestureRecognizer is UnifiedInputSwipeTabsPanGestureRecognizer)
  || (gestureRecognizer is UnifiedInputSwipeTabsPanGestureRecognizer && otherGestureRecognizer is SwipeUpToTabSwitcherPanGestureRecognizer) {
      return false
  }
  return true
  ```
- Install: call `installSwipeUpToTabSwitcherGesture()` next to the existing
  `installSwipeTabsGesturesForUnifiedInput()` invocation
  (`MainViewController+UnifiedToggleInput.swift:124`). Verify that call site runs unconditionally
  during view setup; if it is itself behind unrelated UTI gating, install from the general view-setup
  path instead so the gesture is governed only by our feature flag.

## 6. Edge cases & risks

- **NTP support:** handled — `FromHomeScreenTransition` is already selected by the delegate and uses a
  synchronous live snapshot, so it drives interactively the same way.
- **Single tab:** supported; the animators already scroll to and target the single cell.
- **Repeated reversal mid-gesture:** native to `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition.update`; no extra code.
- **Cancel cleanup:** `tabSwitcherController` is `weak` → auto-nils when the cancelled presentation is
  released; gesture handler nils `tabSwitcherInteractor`; delegate's `activeInteractor` is `weak`.
  **Verify on-device:** after a cancel, the tabs button still opens the switcher and there is no leaked
  overlay.
- **Tabs button tapped mid-gesture:** inert — `segueToTabSwitcher` guards `tabSwitcherController == nil`,
  which we set synchronously at gesture start; and `shouldBegin` blocks starting a gesture while a
  present is in flight.
- **Pan on `navigationBarContainer` vs. address-bar taps:** a `UIPanGestureRecognizer` only claims pans,
  and `shouldBegin` bails while editing; verify tap-to-edit on the address bar still works with the pan
  attached (if it interferes, attach only to `toolbar` + a thin band, or require-failure of the omnibar tap).
- **Tracker-count header:** presenting with `.hidden` then refreshing may pop the banner in a frame late;
  acceptable (it lives inside the tab-switcher view that fades in from alpha 0), and irrelevant in the
  common no-trackers case.

## 7. UX polish during the drag

Two visual refinements layered on top of the working interactive transition. Both stay behind the
`swipeUpToTabSwitcher` flag and leave the button-tap path untouched.

### A. Fade out the whole bottom bar

As the page lifts toward the overview, the bottom bar (the address-bar container **and** the toolbar)
fades away so the chrome gets out of the content's way.

- **Both** `viewCoordinator.navigationBarContainer` and `viewCoordinator.toolbar` fade together —
  alpha 1 → 0 over `barFadeDuration` (0.2s). It is a **fade**, not a slide.
- **Hysteresis** stops boundary flicker: fade out once `progress` rises above
  `hideBarsAboveProgress` (0.05); fade back in once it drops below `showBarsBelowProgress` (0.03).
  A new stored `Bool` on `MainViewController`, `isBottomBarHiddenForSwipeUp` (beside
  `tabSwitcherInteractor`), tracks shown/hidden state so each fade fires only once per crossing
  (`updateBottomBarVisibilityForSwipeUp(progress:)`, driven from the pan's `.changed`).
- **Restore.** On **cancel** (`.ended` not committing, plus `.cancelled`/`.failed`) the bars fade back
  to alpha 1 so the chrome returns as the page snaps back, and the `Bool` resets. On **commit**
  (`finish()`) the bars stay hidden through the finish (the switcher takes over); they are reset to
  alpha 1 and the `Bool` cleared in the `beginInteractiveTabSwitcherPresentation` transition-coordinator
  completion — that runs behind the presented switcher (invisible) and guarantees correct chrome when
  the user later dismisses back to the page. Because that completion also runs on cancel, it doubles as
  a safety net.
- **Correctness:** fade `alpha`, **never** `isHidden`. UIKit uses alpha only for hit-testing the
  *start* of new touches, not the continuation of an active touch, so the in-flight pan keeps tracking
  after its host bar fades to 0; `isHidden` would drop the gesture mid-drag.

Lives in `iOS/DuckDuckGo/Transitions/MainViewController+SwipeUpToTabSwitcher.swift` (thresholds + fade
helpers + `.changed`/`.ended`/`.cancelled` wiring) and `iOS/DuckDuckGo/MainViewController+Segues.swift`
(commit-path restore). The `Bool` is declared in `iOS/DuckDuckGo/MainViewController.swift`.

### B. Keep the NTP Dax logo circular during the drag

**Symptom:** on a fresh New Tab Page the circular Dax logo squeezed vertically as the drag progressed.
Invisible on the button tap (fast 0.2s) but obvious during the slow interactive drag. Web-page previews
are unaffected — this is **NTP-only**.

**Root cause** (`FromHomeScreenTransition` in `iOS/DuckDuckGo/Transitions/HomeScreenTransition.swift`):
`prepareSnapshots` snapshots the whole NTP via `resizableSnapshotView` and pins
`homeScreenSnapshot.frame = imageContainer.bounds`. As `imageContainer` animates from the full-screen
aspect ratio down to the tab-switcher cell's aspect ratio, the snapshot — a `.scaleToFill`-style view —
stretched **non-uniformly**, squeezing the circular logo inside it. The snapshot also faded over the
full drag (`relativeDuration 1.0`) while the crisp settled-state logo (`imageView`, contentMode
`.center`) only began fading in at `startTime 0.6`, so the stretched snapshot was on screen for most of
the gesture.

**Fix** (scoped to `FromHomeScreenTransition`, so `FromWebViewTransition` and the button-tap NTP
transition are unchanged):
- Give `homeScreenSnapshot` `contentMode = .scaleAspectFill` + `clipsToBounds = true` so it keeps its
  contents proportional (cropping, not squeezing) while the container morphs; `imageContainer` already
  clips.
- Accelerate the snapshot's fade-out to `relativeDuration 0.3` and bring the `.center` logo's fade-in
  forward to `startTime 0.2` so the aspect-correct logo carries the middle of the drag. The end state
  (snapshot at alpha 0, logo settled in the cell) is identical to the existing button-tap transition.

### C. Ramp a border on the dragged page preview

**Symptom:** on the light-gray all-tabs background a white page — a web page **or** the New Tab Page —
blends in, so you can't see the page edge or the already-animating rounded corners as the drag
progresses.

**Fix** (applied to **both** `FromWebViewTransition` in
`iOS/DuckDuckGo/Transitions/WebViewTransition.swift` and `FromHomeScreenTransition` in
`iOS/DuckDuckGo/Transitions/HomeScreenTransition.swift`):
- The dragged page-preview (`imageContainer`) ramps a **border** in lockstep with the corner radius
  that already animates over the full-span keyframe (`relativeStartTime 0`, `relativeDuration 1.0`):
  width grows `0 → TabViewCell.Constants.selectedBorderWidth` (2pt) as the radius grows `0 → 12pt`
  (`TabViewCell.Constants.cellCornerRadius`). Because `layer.borderWidth` animates inside a `UIView`
  animation block just like `cornerRadius`, the border width scrubs with the percent-driven drag, and
  since it shares `imageContainer.layer` it automatically follows the rounded corners.
- The max border matches the all-tabs **current-tab** cell: `selectedBorderWidth` and the current-tab
  border **color** `.decorationTertiary` (from `updateCurrentTabBorder` in `TabViewCell.swift`, the
  `isCurrent` / non-selection-mode branch). `borderColor` is set once before the keyframe block;
  `borderWidth` starts at 0 and is bumped to `selectedBorderWidth` inside the shared keyframe.
- At progress 1 the preview is a 12pt-corner, 2pt-bordered card matching the destination cell, then
  it's removed and the real cell shows — seamless. The shared keyframe also runs on the 0.2s
  button-tap present, which is fine/desirable since that path already lands on a bordered current-tab
  cell; there is no interactive-only branching.

### D. Free-form finger-tracking transition (engine rework)

**What changed and why.** The first cut (§2) drove the *existing* `From*` keyframe animation with a
`UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition` — it scrubbed a **fixed keyframe path**, so the dragged page
preview could only interpolate along the pre-baked full-screen→cell trajectory. That cannot let the
preview *follow the finger freely*. Per the product owner, the interaction model is now: the dragged
page preview moves in **2D** with the finger, **scales down** as you drag up, can be dragged around
(not locked to a path), and **snaps** to its destination cell on commit; the overview behind it
**blurs** more the higher you drag and **sharpens** on release. A percent-driven interactor only scrubs
a predetermined animation, so the engine moves to a **custom `UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning`**
driven manually. The tab switcher stays a real `present(...)`ed VC (committing lands in the live
overview); only the interaction controller is swapped — the button-tap and dismissal paths are
unchanged.

This **supersedes the percent-driven mechanism in §2** (the `completeTransition(!…transitionWasCancelled)`
edits there remain correct/harmless for the non-interactive button tap, which still runs the `From*`
`animateTransition` keyframes). Tweaks **A** (bottom-bar fade), **B** (NTP Dax-logo squeeze fix) and
**C** (border + corner ramp) are all preserved — re-expressed as manual per-frame drives instead of
keyframes.

**New file — `iOS/DuckDuckGo/Transitions/SwipeUpToTabSwitcherInteractiveTransition.swift`:**
`final class SwipeUpToTabSwitcherInteractiveTransition: NSObject, UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning`.
- `startInteractiveTransition(_:)`: installs the "to" tab-switcher view full-screen behind everything
  (alpha 0) and calls `prepareForPresentation()`; adds a `UIVisualEffectView(effect: nil)` over it for
  the blur; builds the dragged preview card (`solidBackground` + `imageContainer` + `imageView`) at the
  full-content initial frame and pre-scrolls the collection to the current tab — all via the `From*`
  animator's shared setup (see below), so geometry is **not duplicated**. Does **not** auto-animate.
- `update(translation:verticalProgress:)` (called each `.changed`): `imageContainer.transform =
  T(translation) · T(0,+h/2) · S(s) · T(0,−h/2)` — i.e. scale by `s` about the card's **bottom-centre**
  (offset `+h/2` from centre, `h = initialContainerFrame.height`) then translate by the finger — where
  `s` maps 1.0 (progress 0) → `minScale` (~0.5, tunable) at full vertical progress. The **bottom edge of
  the card rides the finger** (stays at `initialContainerFrame.maxY` and tracks the finger in x/y, top
  edge comes down as it shrinks) — like lifting the page by its bottom edge (the swipe starts on the
  bottom bar) — instead of the old centre anchor, where only the centre followed the finger so the card
  drifted up off the finger as it shrank. At `(translation == .zero, scale == 1)` the transform is
  identity → no start jump. Also ramps `cornerRadius 0→cellCornerRadius` and
  `borderWidth 0→selectedBorderWidth` with progress; cross-fades the NTP snapshot out to the crisp
  `.center` logo (the §B squeeze fix, re-expressed per-frame); scrubs the **inverted** blur (below);
  calls `context.updateInteractiveTransition(verticalProgress)`.
- **Inverted blur (Safari-style).** Blur is **heaviest at/near the start** of the drag and **decreases as
  the finger rises**, so you see more of the overview the higher you go (where you care about where
  you'll land). It is *not* the saturating card-shrink `verticalProgress`: `currentBlurFraction()` derives
  a **separate blur progress from `lastTranslation.y` against a near-full-height reference**
  (`blurView.height * blurProgressReferenceFraction`, bigger than the visual half-height reference) so it
  keeps easing across the **upper half** of the screen rather than maxing at mid-screen. A `smoothstep`
  between `blurEaseStart` and `blurEaseEnd` (of blur progress) maps `maxBlur → minBlurDuringDrag`: stays
  heavy early (grid not really visible ~1/3 up), noticeably less but still very blurry around halfway
  (grid starting to show), progressively clearer higher. It **never fully clears mid-drag** (floored at
  `minBlurDuringDrag`); **only commit sharpens to 0** (`finish()`'s `fractionComplete → 0`). The animator
  starts at `fractionComplete = maxBlur`.
- `finish(verticalVelocity:)` (commit): bakes the live transform into the card's `frame` (flicker-free,
  reconstructed from the last translation+scale with the **same bottom-centre anchoring**) — necessary
  because the destination **cell has a different aspect ratio** than the page, which a single transform
  can't match — then spring-animates `frame → destinationCellFrame`, `cornerRadius → cellCornerRadius`,
  `borderWidth → selectedBorderWidth`, `imageView → destinationImageViewFrame`, **sharpens** the blur
  (`fractionComplete → 0`), fades the switcher fully in; on completion tears down overlays, stops the
  blur animator (no leak), `finishInteractiveTransition()` + `completeTransition(true)`. Duration is
  **velocity-scaled** for a flick, and the commit snap uses a **lower spring damping**
  (`commitSpringDamping ~0.74`, vs the calmer `springDamping 0.86` for cancel) plus a small flick-derived
  `initialSpringVelocity` (capped) so the card **settles with a tasteful little bounce**.
- `cancel()`: bakes (bottom-centre anchored), then animates the card back to the full-content frame with
  the calm `springDamping` (no bounce on the way back), `corner/border → 0`, blur → 0, switcher
  alpha → 0; on completion tears down, `cancelInteractiveTransition()` + `completeTransition(false)`.
- **Blur technique:** `UIViewPropertyAnimator(duration: 1, curve: .linear)` toggling
  `blurView.effect = UIBlurEffect(style: .systemThinMaterial)`, `pausesOnCompletion = true`, scrubbed via
  `fractionComplete` (now driven by the inverted `currentBlurFraction()`, max at start);
  `stopAnimation(true)` on teardown. Blur style is a tuning knob (`.systemThinMaterial` vs
  `.regular`/`.systemMaterial` over the light-gray overview).

**Shared geometry (no duplication).** `FromWebViewTransition` and `FromHomeScreenTransition` adopt a new
`SwipeUpInteractiveTransition` protocol with `prepareInteractivePreview(in:finalFrame:)`, which reuses
their existing `tabSwitcherCellFrame` / `previewFrame` / `prepareSnapshots` / logo / border-colour setup
and returns a `SwipeUpInteractivePreview` (the live subviews + `initialContainerFrame`,
`destinationCellFrame`, `destinationImageViewFrame`). The snap therefore lands **pixel-identical** to the
button-tap end state. (`prepareSnapshots` lost its unused `transitionContext` parameter as part of this.)

**Delegate wiring (`TabSwitcherTransition.swift`).** `TabSwitcherTransitionDelegate.activeInteractor`
(typed `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition`) becomes `activeInteractiveTransition` typed as the broader
`UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning`, returned from `interactionControllerForPresentation(using:)`.
`animationController(forPresented:)` still returns a `From*` animator (UIKit requires one; its
`animateTransition` is bypassed while the interaction controller drives, but it still provides
`transitionDuration` and runs the non-interactive button tap). Button taps leave it nil → unchanged.

**Gesture handler (`MainViewController+SwipeUpToTabSwitcher.swift`).** `tabSwitcherInteractor` is retyped
to the custom controller. `.began` creates it and hands it to `beginInteractiveTabSwitcherPresentation`.
`.changed` passes `gesture.translation(in:)` and a **visual** progress to `update(...)`: the commit
threshold + bar-fade keep the full-content-height reference (unchanged trigger), while the card
shrink/blur use a **half-height reference** (`visualProgressReferenceFraction = 0.5`) so visuals saturate
around mid-screen (the product owner's "~100% ≈ mid-screen" model; tunable). `.ended` keeps the existing
`shouldCommit(progress:verticalVelocity:)` decision + open pixels on commit + bottom-bar restore, calling
`finish(verticalVelocity:)` / `cancel()`. The commit-path bar restore + interactor release still run in
the `beginInteractiveTabSwitcherPresentation` transition-coordinator completion (verified).

**Tuning knobs (need on-device feel):** `minScale`, `visualProgressReferenceFraction`, the bottom-centre
anchor feel; the inverted-blur shape — `maxBlur`, `minBlurDuringDrag`, `blurEaseStart`/`blurEaseEnd`,
`blurProgressReferenceFraction`, and the blur style/intensity; the commit bounce — `commitSpringDamping`,
`commitInitialSpringVelocityFactor`/`maxCommitInitialSpringVelocity`; and the flick-scaled snap durations
(`snapDuration` / `min`/`maxCommitDuration` / `springDamping` for the calm cancel return).

### E. Three landing fixes (overview-visible blur, pixel-perfect commit, card header bar)

Three corrections on top of the free-form engine (§7.D). All three touch
`SwipeUpToTabSwitcherInteractiveTransition.swift`, `TabSwitcherTransition.swift`, `WebViewTransition.swift`
and `HomeScreenTransition.swift`; the button-tap and dismissal paths stay untouched.

**E.1 — The overview is visible (blurred) during the drag.** `startInteractiveTransition` previously set
`toVC.view.alpha = 0` for the whole drag, so the `UIVisualEffectView` blur sampled only the opaque
`solidBackground` → blurred gray, not the tabs. Fix: set `toVC.view.alpha = 1` in
`startInteractiveTransition` so the live grid renders during the drag; the card covers it at full size and
reveals it — blurred by `blurView` (already z-ordered between the overview and the card) — as it shrinks.
`finish()` keeps alpha 1 + blur → 0 (sharpen); `cancel()` fades alpha → 0 as the page returns; the
nil-preview fallback now resets alpha → 0 before its fade-in so that path still animates. The inverted-blur
`Constants` were later retuned in §7.F.1 (grid legible by ~⅓ up); the `currentBlurFraction()` curve is
unchanged. `interactive.update` / `interactive.start` log `overviewAlpha` next to `blur` so it's
confirmable that the real grid is what's blurred.

**E.2 — Commit snaps pixel-perfect on the real cell (no jump).** The overview is presented with the
tracker-count banner hidden (synchronous present; `initialTrackerCountState: .hidden`). The page controller
then fetches the count and inserts the "N trackers blocked" banner **as a collection-view section header**
(`referenceSizeForHeaderInSection` goes from `.zero` to `estimatedHeight`, `invalidateLayout()`), pushing
every grid cell DOWN — **after** `destinationCellFrame` was captured at gesture start. So the card snapped
too high and jumped down when the snapshot was removed. Fix: a new `SwipeUpInteractiveTransition` protocol
method `currentDestinationFrames() -> SwipeUpDestinationFrames?` (returns `cell` + `imageView` + `header`),
implemented by both `From*` animators by calling `collectionView.layoutIfNeeded()` (to flush a freshly
inserted banner) then re-querying `layoutAttributesForItem(at:)` and re-running their existing
`tabSwitcherCellFrame` / `previewFrame` / `headerFrame` math. The controller calls it at the top of
`finish()` and snaps to the fresh frames (cell + imageView + header), falling back to the stored ones if
nil; it logs `capturedCell`, `freshCell`, and `cellDeltaY` so the shift is visible (expected `cellDeltaY ≈
+estimatedHeight (50)` in the no-trackers→trackers case; `0` when the banner stays hidden).

**E.3 — The cell's top bar (favicon + title + X) on the dragged card.** The all-tabs cells have a
`cellHeaderHeight`-tall top bar (favicon, page title, close X) the card lacked → empty space at the top
when it landed. Fix: a new `SwipeUpCardHeaderView` (in `TabSwitcherTransition.swift`) replicates
`TabViewGridCell`'s header — favicon (16pt, leading 12, `faviconCornerRadius`), title (`daxFootnoteSemibold`
/ `.textPrimary`, `FadeOutLabel`), and a decorative `BrowserChromeButton(.tabSwitcher)` X with
`Size16.close` — laid out frame-based in `layoutSubviews` against the grid cell's metrics. It is populated
per surface (web favicon+title, Duck.ai icon+"Duck.ai", NTP Dax logo + home-tab title) by a shared
`makeSwipeUpCardHeader(for:)` factory on `TabSwitcherTransition`. The X is **decorative only** — not wired
to close anything (the card is transient). The controller adds it as a **sibling above `imageContainer`**
(not a subview — so the NTP header can sit *above* the preview-only container), starts it at alpha 0,
**fades it in with `progress` in lockstep with the border/corner ramp**, and rides it on the card's current
top edge each `.changed` (`headerFrame(forCardRect: currentCardRect(...))`). On commit it snaps to
`destinationHeaderFrame` (absolute tab-switcher-view space): for web that's the cell's top strip
(`cellFrame.minY`), for NTP it's the strip directly above the preview-region cell frame
(`cellFrame.minY - cellHeaderHeight`) — both recomputed from the fresh cell frame in E.2. Content is laid
out in the 44pt header-stack box pinned to the cell top, so favicon/title/X centre at the same y as the real
cell's header → pixel-match on handoff (the ±4pt header/preview boundary is the pre-existing 40-vs-44
transition approximation, unchanged). `cancel()` fades the header back out and returns it to the full-screen
card's top edge; `tearDown` removes it. Applies to **both** web and NTP.

### F. Final polish (legible blur by ~⅓ up; opaque cell-matching card; hide the dragged cell)

Three further refinements on top of §7.E. All stay behind the `swipeUpToTabSwitcher` flag; the button-tap and
dismissal paths are untouched.

**F.1 — Grid legible by ~⅓ of the way up (blur retune).** The blur previously stayed heavy until ~50% drag
(its ease window cleared too late). Per the product owner the grid should be clearly legible by ~⅓ of the way
up while still starting heavy at the very bottom. Only the inverted-blur `Constants` in
`SwipeUpToTabSwitcherInteractiveTransition.swift` change (the `currentBlurFraction()` math is unchanged):
`maxBlur 1.0 → 0.7` (≈30% less peak — visibly frosted but with headroom), `minBlurDuringDrag 0.18 → 0.10`
(light enough that the grid reads clearly at the floor), `blurEaseStart 0.30 → 0.05` and
`blurEaseEnd 0.85 → 0.35`. With the unchanged `blurProgressReferenceFraction 0.9`, the smoothstep reaches its
floor at `blurProgress ≈ 0.35` — i.e. ≈⅓ of the screen height — so the blur ramps from heavy at the bottom to
its legible floor by ~⅓ up, then holds (commit still sharpens to 0). All five remain tunable `Constants` for
the product owner to fine-tune.

**F.2 — Opaque, cell-matching card background (fix the "doubled title").** During the commit spring the card's
background behind the header strip was transparent (web) or the page `theme.backgroundColor` (NTP), so the real
cell's title showed through → the title looked doubled for a split second. The all-tabs grid cell's card is the
`RoundedRectangleView background`, whose colour is `.surfaceTertiary` (set in `TabViewCell.decorate()`); the
cell's header (favicon/title/X) is added to that `background`. Fix: set
`imageContainer.backgroundColor = UIColor(designSystemColor: .surfaceTertiary)` from the START of the drag in
**both** `prepareInteractivePreview` paths (`FromWebViewTransition` in `WebViewTransition.swift` — previously no
background; `FromHomeScreenTransition` in `HomeScreenTransition.swift` — previously `theme.backgroundColor`), so
the card is opaque on the same surface as the real cell throughout, not just at commit. The `SwipeUpCardHeaderView`
(in `TabSwitcherTransition.swift`) also gets `backgroundColor = .surfaceTertiary` in its `init`, so the header
strip is opaque over that surface and nothing shows through behind the title. (No `finish()` background change is
needed — the container is already the right colour the whole time.)

**F.3 — Hide the dragged tab's cell in the grid during the transition.** The dragged card and the dragged tab's
real overview cell were both visible, risking a doubled tab / seam at the landing. Fix: hide the
currently-dragged tab's cell in the overview's collection view for the whole transition and restore it on
completion. New API `TabSwitcherViewController.setTransitioningTabCellHidden(_:)` delegates to the visible
`TabSwitcherPageViewController`. **Robust to layout changes:** the page controller tracks a
`hiddenTransitioningIndexPath` (the current tab, `tabsModel.currentIndex`, section 0) and applies
`cell.isHidden = (indexPath == hiddenTransitioningIndexPath)` in **both** `collectionView(_:cellForItemAt:)` and
`collectionView(_:willDisplay:forItemAt:)` — so the tracker-count banner inserting mid-transition (which
invalidates layout and re-displays cells, undoing a one-shot `isHidden`) cannot un-hide it. On hide it also sets
the currently-visible cell's `isHidden = true` immediately; on restore it clears the flag and sets the visible
cell's `isHidden = false` (no `reloadItems`, which would be unsafe mid-batch-update). The interaction controller
(`SwipeUpToTabSwitcherInteractiveTransition.swift`) calls `setTransitioningTabCellHidden(true)` in
`startInteractiveTransition` (after `prepareForPresentation()` + the scroll-to-current-tab in
`prepareInteractivePreview`) and `setTransitioningTabCellHidden(false)` in **both** the `finish()` and `cancel()`
completion blocks **and** the `finishImmediatelyAsCancel()` fallback (no-op if never hidden). On commit the cell
reappears once the card is gone; on cancel it's cleaned up (the page is shown). This does **not** affect Fix
E.2's commit recompute (`layoutAttributesForItem` is position, not visibility) or the scroll-to-current-tab. An
`os_log` line is logged on both hide and restore.

**F.3 robustness fix — eliminate the hidden-cell timing race.** The original hide applied a one-shot
`collectionView.cellForItem(at: indexPath)?.isHidden = true`. That call returns **nil when the post-scroll
layout hasn't been flushed**: `setTransitioningTabCellHidden(true)` runs immediately after the
`scrollToItem(animated:false)` in `prepareInteractivePreview`, whose new content offset is applied but whose
cell realization is still pending, so the hide silently no-opped and the cell stayed visible mid-drag (the
"still visible" flake). A late reflow (the tracker banner) would then re-display it hidden, after which a
direct `cell.update(...)` (which resets `isHidden = false`) on the still-on-screen cell un-hid it again (the
"disappears then reappears" flake). Fixes:
1. `setTransitioningTabCellHidden(_:)` now **forces `collectionView.layoutIfNeeded()`** before acting, then
   **sweeps `indexPathsForVisibleItems`** (via a `sweepVisibleCells(hidingMatching:)` helper) and sets
   `isHidden` on the cell matching `hiddenTransitioningIndexPath` — instead of relying on a single
   `cellForItem(at:)` that can be nil. Restore (`false`) clears the flag and sweeps to un-hide.
2. The call site (`startInteractiveTransition`) also calls `toVC.view.layoutIfNeeded()` **after** the scroll
   and **before** the hide, making the "cells realized before the sweep" ordering explicit (belt-and-suspenders
   with (1)).
3. `didChange(tab:)` (the `TabObserver` path, which calls `cell.update(...)` directly and bypasses
   `cellForItemAt`/`willDisplay`) now **re-asserts** `isHidden = true` when the updated row is the hidden slot,
   so a favicon/title/preview load mid-drag can't un-hide the dragged cell. (`cellForItemAt` already applies the
   flag after `update(...)`; the tracker banner is a supplementary header whose re-display is handled by
   `willDisplay` and does not reconfigure the cell.)
4. Diagnostic `Logger.swipeUpToTabSwitcher` lines (all `privacy: .public`) were added so the race can be
   confirmed on-device: hide/restore log the index path, `currentIndex`, visible-cell count, and whether the
   matching cell was found at hide-time; `cellForItemAt`/`willDisplay`/the `didChange` re-assert each log when
   they hide the row.

The empty-gap / no-reflow behavior is unchanged: `isHidden` keeps the slot in the layout, so the other tabs do
not reflow — the dragged slot stays an empty gap for the whole interaction and the cell reappears exactly on
commit. Page-controller + index targeting is unchanged (`activePageController`, `tabsModel.currentIndex`,
section 0).

## Verification / testing

**Manual (the primary verification — feel is the point of the project).** Build & run on an iPhone sim
(ad-hoc signing `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-"` per project memory). Settings → set the address bar to
**Bottom**. Debug menu → **Feature Flags** → enable **swipeUpToTabSwitcher**. Then on a web page (and
separately on a fresh NTP), from the bottom bar:
- Slow drag up ~halfway, release → snaps back; tabs button still opens normally afterward.
- Slow drag past ~35%, release → commits into the overview.
- Quick flick up from rest → commits (velocity case).
- Drag up, drag fully back down, release → cancels.
- Rapidly reverse up/down within one gesture → view follows smoothly.
- Confirm: horizontal swipe-to-switch-tabs still works on the same bar; **top** address bar and **iPad**
  show no gesture; tapping the tabs button mid-drag is inert; single-tab case lands in a one-tab overview.
- **Bottom-bar fade (Tweak A):** at the start of the drag the whole bottom bar fades out; the gesture
  keeps tracking after it fades (it does not get cut off). On cancel the bar fades back in with the page;
  after committing then dismissing the switcher back to the page, the bar is fully visible (alpha 1).
- **NTP Dax logo (Tweak B):** on a fresh NTP, drag slowly to ~50% — the Dax logo stays circular (no
  vertical squeeze) throughout, and the settled overview cell looks identical to the button-tap result.
- **Overview visible & blurred (Fix E.1):** during the drag the real tab grid is visible behind the card,
  heavily frosted near the bottom and clearing as you rise — not a flat blurred gray. On commit it sharpens
  to a crisp overview; on cancel it fades out as the page returns.
- **Pixel-perfect commit (Fix E.2):** on a tab with trackers (so the "N trackers blocked" banner appears),
  release to commit — the card lands exactly on the destination cell with no downward jump when the
  snapshot is removed. Re-check with the banner absent (no-trackers tab) — still no jump. Web + NTP both.
- **Card header bar (Fix E.3):** as the card shrinks, the top bar (favicon + page title + X) fades in at
  the card's top; on landing it coincides exactly with the real cell's header (favicon, title, X all in
  place, no empty strip, no jump). Verify on a web page (real favicon + title) and on a fresh NTP (Dax logo
  + home-tab title). The X is inert (tapping it does nothing — the card is removed on commit anyway).
- **Legible blur by ~⅓ up (F.1):** at the very bottom of the drag the grid is heavily frosted; by ~⅓ of the
  way up the screen the grid is clearly legible (and stays legible higher up). Commit still sharpens to a
  crisp overview. Web + NTP.
- **No doubled title (F.2):** during the commit spring the card's header/title sits on an opaque,
  cell-matching surface — the real cell's title does NOT show through behind it (no doubled title for a
  split second). Verify web (real title) and NTP (home-tab title); light and dark mode (the surface adapts).
- **Dragged cell hidden (F.3):** during the whole transition the dragged tab's cell is hidden in the grid
  (only the card represents it — no second copy / seam). On **commit** the cell reappears once the card has
  landed (the overview shows the tab normally afterward). On **cancel** there's no leftover hidden cell if
  the overview is revisited. Re-check on a tab **with trackers** (so the "N trackers blocked" banner inserts
  mid-transition) — the cell stays hidden through the banner insertion and still reappears after commit.
  Web + NTP.

**Unit tests.** Cover the pure `progress(forTranslation:reference:)` and
`shouldCommit(progress:velocity:)` helpers (flick at low progress commits; below-threshold lift cancels;
clamping). Run via the existing `iOS Unit Tests` scheme / `UnitTests` target with
`-only-testing:UnitTests/<Suite>` (per project memory).
